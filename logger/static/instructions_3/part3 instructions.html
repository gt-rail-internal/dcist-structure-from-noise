        <strong>Instructions: </strong>  <br>
        <span>
          In this task, you will control a team of virtual robots exploring a building.  Your goal is to have the robots explore the building to find flags.  Each flagged location represents an information cache.  Robots will download information from each cache, and once all information is obtained the cache flag will disappear and a new flag will spawn somewhere in the space.  The task ends when the required amount of information is collected.
          <br>
          <br>
          The task has two stages, a tutorial stage and the trial stage.  In total, the task is expected to take 20 minutes.
          The task will take you to another web page.  Please read the following instructions first:

            <strong>1. Start</strong>
            <br>
             Copy your Worker ID before you begin.
             <br>
             <br>
             When you go to the external webpage, you will see a blank map.  Zoom out your browser window (usually ctrl -) if needed to see the whole map.
             <br><br>
             Once you click on the GO button, you will be asked for your Worker ID in a dialog box.
             <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            After entering your ID, click OK and the tutorial mode will begin.  Once you are finished with the tutorial stage, the trial stage will begin.
            <br>
                **Note if you go back to this page when the dialog box is open, your browser will crash.  Refresh the page and try again.

              <strong>Task Objective:</strong><br>
              Your task will be to find randomly appearing and disappearing flags around the map.  They will become visible and give you points when your robots that you control are nearby.

              You will be able to select robots by click and dragging across them.  Robots can be controlled whenever they are connected either directly or indirectly to the pentagon orange base on the top right.  Disconnected agents can&#39;t be controlled.

              The tutorial task will end after 150 points or a few minutes and the main task will end after 2500 points or about 15 minutes.  You are required to complete the tasks in a single sitting, and will not be allowed to re-attempt it.  Do not refresh your web page before completing it.  The webpage will remind you of these instructions and tell you when to return here.
