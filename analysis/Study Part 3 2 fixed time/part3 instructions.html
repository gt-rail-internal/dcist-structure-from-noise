        <strong>Instructions: </strong>  <br>
        <span>
          In this HIT task, you will control a team of virtual robots exploring three maps.
            Your goal is to have the robots explore the maps to find flags with information.
            Robots will download information from each flag, and once all information is obtained the flag will disappear.

          <br><br>
          This task will take you to another web page and has three phases, a tutorial map (2 minutes) and two regular maps (7 minutes each).  It is expected to take under 20 minutes total.
          <br><br>

            <br><strong>Task Objective:</strong><br>
            Your task will be to find flags dispersed around the map.  They will be visible for 5 seconds during the beginning of the map phase for you to remember their positions. Flags will appear when you are nearby and collecting information from them. They will disappear once all information is collected and will not reappear or respawn.

              Remember, you will be shown where the flags are in the beginning.  Try to remember those positions as it will help you during the task.
              <br><br>
               To get credit for the task, you must engage honestly with the task and try to find at least around 10 robots out of the 15 shown in each of the regular maps!
