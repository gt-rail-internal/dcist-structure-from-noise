        <strong>Instructions: </strong>  <br>
        <span>
            This HIT requires you to complete a task on 10 different "maps", for which you will be taken to another web page. This task is expected to take around 10 minutes. <br> Please read the instructions below carefully before attempting it.
        </span>
        <div>
            <br><br>
            <strong>1. Start</strong>
            <br>
             Copy your Worker ID before you begin.
             <br>
             When you go to the external webpage and click on the 'START' button, you will be asked for your Worker ID in a dialog box.
             <br><br>
            <div>
            <img src="http://34.227.18.144/static/images/user_id.png">
            </div>
            After entering your ID, click OK.
            <br>
                **Note if you go back to this page when the dialog box is open, your browser will crash.  Refresh the page and try again.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>
            Now the task will show you a pattern of many squares, and the web page should look like the image below. DO NOT click on the 'START' button again.
            <br>
            <div>
            <img src="http://34.227.18.144/static/images/Part2/start.PNG" width=50%>
            </div>
            <br><strong>2. Observation</strong><br>
            In this stage, you will watch the colors change after different nodes (squares) are selected by our task.  Observe carefully as you will not be able to go back to this stage.
            <div>
            <img src="http://34.227.18.144/static/images/Part2/propogating.PNG" width=50%>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <br><strong>3. Selection</strong><br>
            In this stage, you will use the information that you have about the map to select the nodes that allow for the fastest propagation.<br>
            You will continue to the next stage if you either pick the correct one(s) or perform three attempts at the previous stage.
            <br>
            <div>
            <img src="http://34.227.18.144/static/images/Part2/clickoncursor.PNG" width=50%>
            </div>
            <br><br>


            <br><br>The task will end with a total of 10 different maps.  You are required to complete the task in a single sitting, and will not be allowed to re-attempt it.
            <br>
            You are expected to take around <b>10 minutes</b> to complete this task. Do not refresh your web page before completing it.  The webpage will tell you when to return here.

            <div>
                <p></p>
                <!-- Your website URLs will be substituted for the "url" variable when you publish
                       a batch with an input file containing multiple website URLs -->
                 Copy your worker ID first and then:
