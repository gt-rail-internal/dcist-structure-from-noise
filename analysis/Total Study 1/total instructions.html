            In this last part, you will control a team of virtual robots exploring three maps.
              Your goal is to have the robots explore the maps to find flags with information.
              Robots will download information from each flag, and once all information is obtained the flag will disappear.

            <br><br>
            This task will take you to another web page and has three phases, a tutorial map (2 minutes) and two regular maps where you must find 10 flags out of 15.  Depending on how fast you can find the hidden flags, it is expected to take under 20 minutes total

              Your task will be to find flags dispersed around the map.  They will be visible for 5 seconds during the beginning of the map phase for you to remember their positions. Flags will appear when you are nearby and collecting information from them. They will disappear once all information is collected and will not reappear or respawn.
